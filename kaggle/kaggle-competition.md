*Author: Bouarfa Mahi*  
*Date: February 24, 2025*


## Overview for PhD Researchers##  

Structured Knowledge Accumulation (SKA) is a groundbreaking, backpropagation-free learning framework that redefines neural network optimization through layer-wise entropy reduction. Unlike classical deep learning, SKA autonomously refines decision probabilities using an entropy-driven forward update mechanism, eliminating the need for gradient descent.  

This competition challenges participants to benchmark SKA against conventional methods (SGD, backpropagation) on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and text Q&A datasets in few-shot, high-uncertainty settings. By tracking entropy convergence, cosine alignment, and decision evolution, researchers can explore SKA’s potential as a mathematically grounded, interpretable alternative to backpropagation.  

This competition invites PhD researchers to validate SKA’s role in structured learning, autonomous knowledge accumulation, and uncertainty reduction—critical elements for advancing next-generation AI.

# 2. Introduction for Kaggle Competitors

This document outlines the details of a Kaggle competition designed to benchmark the [Structured Knowledge Accumulation (SKA) framework](http://dx.doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.2.35390.80963)—a novel, backpropagation-free approach to neural learning developed as a theoretical concept. SKA redefines entropy as a dynamic, layer-wise process $$ H^{(l)} = -\frac{1}{\ln 2} \sum_{k=1}^{K} \mathbf{z}^{(l)}_k \cdot \Delta \mathbf{D}^{(l)}_k $$, offering a fresh perspective on pattern recognition. Participants are invited to explore its potential against classical models. Notebooks and models are enabled, allowing you to work directly on Kaggle with the provided datasets.

# 3. Overall Objective of the Competition

This competition aims to benchmark SKA—a neural learning framework that replaces backpropagation with an entropy-driven approach $$ H^{(l)} = -\frac{1}{\ln 2} \sum_{k=1}^{K} \mathbf{z}^{(l)}_k \cdot \Delta \mathbf{D}^{(l)}_k $$. The task involves implementing SKA and comparing it to traditional models (such as SGD) across MNIST (digits), Fashion-MNIST (clothing), CIFAR-10 (images), and a text Q&A set, using 100 samples per class (some noisy) for image datasets and 100 total Q&A pairs. The goal is to determine if SKA’s autonomous learning can surpass classical methods in few-shot scenarios and establish a performance baseline.

# 4. Competition Problem Statement in a Single Sentence

SKA’s entropy-driven, forward-only learning seeks to outperform classical models in recognizing patterns across MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and Q&A datasets with minimal, noisy data.

# 5. Specific Feature for Participants to Predict

Participants will predict class labels—digits (0–9) for MNIST, clothing types for Fashion-MNIST, objects for CIFAR-10, and text answers for Q&A—leveraging SKA’s entropy-based pattern recognition on small, noisy datasets.

# 6. Methods and Existing Models Tried and Current Benchmarks

[SKA is a theoretical framework](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/389272110_Structured_Knowledge_Accumulation_An_Autonomous_Framework_for_Layer-Wise_Entropy_Reduction_in_Neural_Learning) featuring entropy-driven learning $$ H^{(l)} = -\frac{1}{\ln 2} \sum_{k=1}^{K} \mathbf{z}^{(l)}_k \cdot \Delta \mathbf{D}^{(l)}_k $$ and forward updates, yet to be implemented. Classical shallow neural networks with SGD and backpropagation serve as established baselines for comparison. No SKA benchmarks currently exist—this competition offers the opportunity to create them from the ground up.

# 7. Potential Impact on the Industry or Field

Benchmarking SKA $$ H^{(l)} = -\frac{1}{\ln 2} \sum_{k=1}^{K} \mathbf{z}^{(l)}_k \cdot \Delta \mathbf{D}^{(l)}_k $$ could influence the AI industry by demonstrating a simpler, more interpretable alternative to classical models, excelling in few-shot learning across diverse datasets. Success here may inspire lightweight AI solutions for resource-constrained environments like edge devices and real-time applications.

# 8. Type of Data Available

The competition provides diverse data in small subsets to evaluate SKA’s few-shot capabilities:
- **MNIST**: 1,000 samples (10 digit classes × 100 samples/class) as `mnist_subset_100_per_class.pt`—28×28 grayscale PyTorch tensors (0–1), labels 0–9, some with added noise.
- **Fashion-MNIST**: 1,000 samples (10 clothing classes × 100 samples/class) as `fashion_mnist_subset_100_per_class.pt`—28×28 grayscale PyTorch tensors (0–1), labels 0–9 (e.g., 0 = T-shirt/top, 1 = Trouser), some noisy.
- **CIFAR-10**: 1,000 samples (10 object classes × 100 samples/class) as `cifar10_subset_100_per_class.pt`—32×32 RGB PyTorch tensors ([3, 32, 32], 0–1), labels 0–9 (e.g., 0 = Airplane, 1 = Automobile), some noisy.
- **Text Q&A**: 100 Q&A pairs as `qa_subset_100.json`—JSON with `"question"`, `"answer"`, `"context"`, and `"category"` (e.g., General), sourced from SQuAD, no per-class split but diverse topics.

Full public versions of MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10 are accessible on Kaggle for additional exploration.

# 9. Availability of the Final Dataset

The final datasets are not yet fully prepared—initial subsets (100 samples per class for images, 100 total Q&A pairs) for MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and Q&A, some noisy, are provided as described above. Full public versions are accessible on Kaggle, allowing participants to refine and expand the benchmark dataset during the competition.

# 10. Availability of Ground Truth

SKA operates without traditional ground truth, learning patterns autonomously via entropy $$ H^{(l)} = -\frac{1}{\ln 2} \sum_{k=1}^{K} \mathbf{z}^{(l)}_k \cdot \Delta \mathbf{D}^{(l)}_k $$, but for evaluation purposes, class labels for MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and Q&A answers are publicly available on Kaggle to assess prediction accuracy.

# 11.Preferred Scoring Metric and Leaderboard Measurement

Classification accuracy—percentage of correct class labels (digits, clothing, objects, answers)—is the chosen metric, aligning with SKA’s entropy-driven approach $$ H^{(l)} = -\frac{1}{\ln 2} \sum_{k=1}^{K} \mathbf{z}^{(l)}_k \cdot \Delta \mathbf{D}^{(l)}_k $$. The leaderboard will display average accuracy across MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and Q&A test sets, based on 100 training samples per class for images and 100 total Q&A pairs, to highlight SKA’s few-shot learning performance in real time.

# 12. Tensor-based implementation of SKA

To enable efficient computation and scalability, we propose a [tensor-based implementation](http://dx.doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.2.12577.72807) of the Structured Knowledge Accumulation (SKA) framework. This approach maintains the theoretical foundation while optimizing operations for parallel computing.

# 13. Tweaks for SKA Implementation

A key requirement for implementing **Structured Knowledge Accumulation (SKA)** is ensuring that knowledge updates remain small and controlled. Instead of making arbitrary changes, SKA adjusts knowledge at each step using weights and biases. This condition is essential for three reasons:

## 13.1 Stability in Knowledge Growth  
- Knowledge evolves through structured updates based on learned relationships rather than sudden jumps.  
- SKA ensures that each step builds upon the previous one in a predictable way, preventing unstable shifts in decision-making.  
- Without controlled updates, rapid changes could disrupt the learning process, leading to inconsistent predictions.

## 13.2 Gradual Reduction of Uncertainty  
- SKA minimizes uncertainty by refining decisions step by step.  
- Sudden jumps in knowledge could cause erratic shifts in confidence, making learning unpredictable.  
- Keeping updates small allows the model to reduce uncertainty smoothly, making learning more reliable.

## 13.3 Better Generalization in Few-Shot Learning  
- Since SKA operates with only a limited number of samples per class, maintaining stability is crucial.  
- If knowledge updates are too large, the model could either memorize patterns too quickly (overfitting) or struggle to find consistent relationships (diverging).  
- A controlled update process ensures that SKA learns effectively while maintaining flexibility across different tasks.

#  14. Entropy Heat Map as a Monitoring Tool  
- SKA introduces a **layer-wise entropy heat map**, which visually tracks entropy reduction across neurons and layers.  
- This diagnostic tool provides a **real-time health check of the network**, ensuring that entropy decreases progressively as knowledge is structured.  
- High entropy regions in the heat map indicate areas where knowledge accumulation is unstable or inefficient, helping fine-tune model parameters.  
- Monitoring entropy shifts across layers allows early detection of training inconsistencies and prevents divergence.  

By following this structured approach, SKA achieves a balance between learning new patterns and maintaining stability, making it a more general and adaptable framework beyond neural networks. The entropy heat map serves as a **critical diagnostic tool**, ensuring that SKA operates autonomously while maintaining **structured knowledge accumulation** across all layers.




# 15. Clarification on the Use of SKA vs. Classical Models

To ensure clarity on the expectations of this competition, this section addresses the role of the **Structured Knowledge Accumulation (SKA) framework** in submissions and how it should be prioritized over classical neural network models.  

##15.1  Focus on SKA's Unique Approach

The primary focus of this competition is to explore and benchmark SKA’s unique entropy-driven, forward-only learning process. While participants are welcome to compare their SKA implementations with traditional models (e.g., stochastic gradient descent, backpropagation), the competition aims to evaluate SKA’s potential as a standalone learning paradigm.

## 15.2 Constraints on the Use of Classical Models

Competitors are encouraged to focus their submissions on demonstrating SKA’s capabilities rather than relying heavily on classical approaches. Implementations that prioritize classical models over SKA may not meet the competition’s primary objectives. Therefore, competitors must use the SKA framework as the primary learning approach in their submissions. Minor comparisons to classical methods are acceptable for benchmarking purposes.

## 15.3 Evaluation Criteria

Submissions will be judged based on:
1. **Implementation of SKA:** The accuracy and effectiveness of the SKA-based solution.
2. **Adherence to SKA Framework:** The extent to which the solution demonstrates SKA’s forward-only, entropy-driven learning process.
3. **Comparison to Classical Models:** If included, how well SKA’s performance compares to classical methods on the provided datasets.
4. **Scalability and Efficiency:** How efficiently SKA handles the provided tasks, especially in few-shot learning scenarios.

## A. Emergent Entropy Convergence in Structured Knowledge Accumulation (SKA)  

This entropy evolution chart illustrates a remarkable phenomenon observed in the **Structured Knowledge Accumulation (SKA) framework**, where knowledge accumulation drives entropy reduction through forward-only updates:  

- **Convergence Phenomenon**: Layers 2, 3, and 4 exhibit a striking entropy convergence at \( K = 49 \), despite independent local entropy minimization.  
- **Layer-Wise Evolution**: Layer 1, initially diverging, progressively aligns with the convergence trajectory as \( K \) increases.  
- **Self-Organizing Dynamics**: This emergent behavior arises without explicit hyperparameter tuning, suggesting an inherent structuring mechanism in entropy-based learning.  

These results highlight SKA’s potential as a **fundamental learning principle**, offering an alternative to backpropagation while preserving structured knowledge accumulation. This behavior suggests the existence of a fundamental law in SKA-based neural networks: 

>In an SKA neural network, layer-wise entropy evolves towards an equilibrium state, where knowledge accumulation stabilizes across hierarchical representations

## B. Cosine Alignment and Knowledge Structuring in SKA

 In addition to entropy evolution, the cosine similarity chart provides key insights into how each layer aligns its knowledge with decision probability shifts.

As training progresses, cosine similarity evolves dynamically, revealing a structured adaptation process. The oscillatory behavior in earlier steps represents an initial exploration phase, while the eventual convergence indicates the emergence of a stable knowledge equilibrium across layers. This confirms SKA’s ability to self-organize without external supervision.

## C. Decision Probability Evolution in SKA

This visualization represents the **mean decision probability evolution** across training steps, revealing how SKA **autonomously differentiates classes** based on entropy reduction.

### **Key Observations:**
1. **Gradual Separation of Decision Probabilities**:
   - Over successive steps, decision probabilities begin to diverge for different classes.
   - The progressive distinction between classes suggests SKA’s ability to structure decision boundaries without gradient-based supervision.
   
2. **Class-Specific Adaptation**:
   - Some classes exhibit **increasing confidence** (higher probabilities), while others **decrease**.
   - This suggests that SKA **adapts knowledge per class dynamically**, refining its classification ability over time.
   
3. **Smooth, Layer-Wise Learning Progression**:
   - Unlike classical deep learning models with abrupt updates, SKA accumulates knowledge **progressively**.
   - The smooth evolution of decision probabilities confirms that **entropy minimization guides learning in a stable, interpretable manner**.

### **Implications for SKA as a Learning Framework:**
- The structured evolution of decision probabilities suggests that **SKA autonomously classifies patterns using entropy shifts alone**. It proves that learning can emerge purely from entropy reduction.
- The absence of drastic separation indicates that **knowledge accumulation follows an internal consistency**, rather than forced memorization.
- This visualization confirms SKA’s potential as a **biologically inspired learning mechanism**, resembling human-like incremental adaptation.

## D. Frobenius Norm Evolution Visualization

This visualization illustrates the evolution of the Frobenius norm of the knowledge tensor across layers during the forward learning process. The plot reveals how the overall magnitude of the pre-sigmoid activations evolves over time. Notably, while some layers exhibit rapid increases in their norms, the final layer demonstrates a more gradual growth. This moderated evolution suggests that although the network drives stronger responses to minimize local entropy, the final layer stabilizes early, promoting balanced knowledge accumulation. Such behavior is crucial in a forward-only learning framework, as it prevents excessive activation scaling in the absence of backward error signals. The Frobenius norm evolution thus provides a valuable diagnostic, complementing entropy and cosine alignment metrics to offer deeper insights into the self-organizing dynamics of SKA.

# 18. Guidance for Competitors: Structured Knowledge Accumulation & Human-Like Learning  

The **Structured Knowledge Accumulation (SKA) framework** is a fully developed alternative to backpropagation, providing a structured way to accumulate knowledge while minimizing uncertainty. Unlike traditional deep learning models, SKA does not rely on explicit gradients for learning but instead refines its decision probabilities dynamically based on entropy shifts.  

This competition invites participants to experiment with SKA, improve its implementation, and validate its few-shot learning and similarity-based recognition capabilities in real-world tasks.  

##  18.1 Understanding SKA’s Knowledge Similarity Concept  
SKA **builds knowledge incrementally**, ensuring that decisions align with accumulated patterns. This aligns closely with **human cognitive learning**, where:  
- **Similarity guides recognition** rather than exact gradient-based optimization.  
- **Uncertainty reduction leads to confidence** in decision-making.  
- **Incremental adjustments** allow learning without abrupt weight changes.  

These properties set SKA apart from conventional deep learning models and provide a new approach to AI model efficiency.  

## 18.2 Research Directions for Competitors 
Competitors are encouraged to experiment with SKA’s structure and explore ways to optimize its knowledge accumulation. Key areas to investigate include:  

### A. Ensuring Monotonic Knowledge Growth 
- The current SKA implementation does not explicitly enforce monotonic growth of knowledge.  
- Competitors can explore methods to regulate knowledge accumulation over layers and time steps to ensure stability.  

### B. Knowledge-Trajectory Optimization  
- Instead of arbitrary weight updates, competitors can explore structured trajectories for weights and biases, ensuring smooth and controlled knowledge evolution. 
- Investigating dynamic scaling of entropy reduction can lead to more precise learning adjustments.  

### C. Tracking Key Metrics for SKA Evolution
  
Competitors should explore quantitative and qualitative tracking of SKA’s behavior to ensure knowledge accumulation follows a structured process. Below are key research directions:

#### 1. Knowledge Tensor Evolution Over Steps and Layers  
- Track how the mean and variance of knowledge evolve across steps.  
- Observe if knowledge accumulation is structured or fluctuates randomly.  
- Identify patterns in knowledge growth that correlate with better decision probability shifts.

#### 2. Determinant of Weight Matrices  
- Compute and analyze the determinant of weight matrices over SKA steps.  
- A stable determinant suggests well-conditioned weight updates, while a decreasing determinant may indicate rank collapse (redundant knowledge).  
- Investigate how stabilizing weight determinants impacts SKA’s performance.

#### 3. Eigenvalue Spectrum of Weights  
- Track eigenvalues of weight matrices across layers.  
- If eigenvalues remain evenly distributed, SKA retains knowledge uniformly.  
- If some eigenvalues dominate, SKA may be concentrating information into a few principal components (useful for compression but may reduce robustness).

#### 4. Compression Ratio Across Layers  
- Compute the ratio of weight norms between layers to measure information compression.  
- A consistent decrease in compression ratio suggests SKA is effectively condensing knowledge.  
- If compression is too aggressive, SKA might lose valuable information.

#### 5. Cosine Similarity Between Knowledge  and Decision Shifts  
- Track the cosine similarity cos(θ) .  
- High alignment (cos(θ) close to 1) means SKA is efficiently structuring knowledge.  
- If cos(θ) fluctuates or remains near zero, it suggests unstable decision updates.

#### Recommended Strategy for Competitors

- **Step 1**: Define how to track these metrics dynamically over SKA steps.  
- **Step 2**: Observe patterns in knowledge evolution and decision probability shifts.  
- **Step 3**: Identify methods to stabilize knowledge accumulation, ensuring structured, monotonic growth.  
- **Step 4**: Optimize weight updates to maintain a well-conditioned transformation across layers.  
- **Step 5**: Use insights from these metrics to propose alternative SKA formulations that improve learning efficiency.


## 18.3 SKA and Few-Shot Learning: A Novel Testing Method  
Since SKA does not rely on traditional optimization, a useful way to validate its performance is through similarity-based retrieval:  

**Testing Idea:**  
1. Provide a single image as input to SKA.  
2. Instead of returning a single class, SKA should retrieve 10 most similar images based on its learned representation.  
3. This method verifies if SKA’s accumulated knowledge allows it to group related patterns correctly, an essential trait of few-shot learning.  

If SKA correctly retrieves semantically similar images, it proves its ability to generalize knowledge beyond simple memorization.  

## 18.4. What Competitors Will Learn Through This Experimentation  
By participating in this competition, competitors will gain a deeper understanding of how knowledge accumulation can be structured without backpropagation. This will help:  
- Validate SKA's potential in reducing dependency on traditional gradient-based learning.  
- Test new ways of structuring learning without explicit weight optimization.  
- Explore SKA’s ability to recognize patterns in few-shot and low-data scenarios.  



SKA is fully functional and ready for experimentation. Competitors are not expected to redefine the framework but rather to explore its adaptability and fine-tune its implementation for real-world applications.
